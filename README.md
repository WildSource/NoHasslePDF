# NoHasslePDF
Free tool to use to convert pdfs with no limits and you don't need to pay unlike certain unamed services. Hopefully compression will be a feature.

## Features
### file conversion
- jpg (scaling issues)
- png
### compression
in uncertain future (if I can figure it out)

## Structure
- There is a core module that holds the app's logic
- a cli tool version (in future)
- a gui version (in future)
